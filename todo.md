TO-DO LIST

1. Rotation Cipher Encyrption 
    - Write a pseudocode algoirthm
    - Attempt code implementations for given text and key (with hard-coded variables)
    - Add FILE I/O 
    - Extensive Comment implementation (so that a new student would be able to understand)
2. Rotation cipher decryption
    - More research?
    - Write a pseudocode algorithm 
    - Attempt code implementation for given cipher text and key
    - Comment implementation
    - Code implementation for cipher text, WITHOUT a key
    - MOAR COMMENTS
3. Substitution Cipher Encyrption
    - Research!!!
    - Write pseudocode
    - Code implementation for given message and alphabet substitution set
    - Comment
4. Substitution cipher decryption
    - RESEARCHHHH
    - Write pseudocode
    - Code implementation for given cipher text and alphabet substitution set
    - like, COMMENT, and subscribe
    - Pseudocode for decryption without substitution set
    - code implementation for decryption WITHOUT a substitution key
    - comment pls
5. User interface specifications
    - can use custom run command lines to use file I/O and take a user input menu input a key and cipher text etc. that can be read to stdin instead of 
      running terminal commands
6. ASCII character conversions
7. Key formatting
8. Convert all algorithms from hard code to Variable input if not done already
9. Check indenting style is correct and consistent
